##### in-memory DB

The requested in-memory DB is a persistence tool 
that allow us to store data in memory by responding to basic 
CRUD operations:

	Create
	Retrieve
	Update
	Delete

You are going to be implementing this in-memory database with persistence on files too, later. 
You'll be working on this database through out the week, 
the excercise is divided into a few sections that will require you 
to implement the requested functionality before going to the next section. 
Inside your GOPATH you will have the src directory, 
this directory may or may not have the github.com folder, 
if it doesn't go ahead and create it. 

Inside the github.com folder create a folder that matches your github username. 
Finally inside that folder create a new one called db
